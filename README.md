# Zeek_script
This repository contains Zeek scripts designed for use as Layer-1 detection components in a multi-sensor environment. Each sensor VM runs Zeek locally, tags its logs with a unique sensor identifier, and performs lightweight anomaly detection before logs are forwarded to a central RITA instance for Layer-2 analysis.
